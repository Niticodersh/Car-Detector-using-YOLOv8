# Car-Detector-using-YOLOv8
This repository will help you to build your own custom car detector. In this repo, I have take a particular camera position and created mask and tracking line for that particular camera position. Developer will need to update the tracking line, limits variable and the mask for the region in which they want to detect the cars.
